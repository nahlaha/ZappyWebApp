# ZappyWebApp
Zappy app is listenning on slack workspace on specific message "go" then fetch tweets  from fictionfone account on twitter and save the tweets in mongodb.
node js server is listening on slack requests so to let slack request my local server i used ngrok which is tunnel between slack and node server.
to run the project 
1-run the nodejs server(nodemon server.js) and then should run the ngrok.exe and type (ngrok.exe http 8080) 
8080 is the port which my server listening on requests
2-open https://api.slack.com/apps/AA03QE97Y/event-subscriptions? 
and type the Forwarding link generated by ngrok followed by /slack (ex: http://208d568f.ngrok.io/slack ) in the slack Request URL and save changes 
 these steps let slack request ngrok and it will send the request to localhost:8080/slack .
 this means node js server is running and listening on slack requests.
 3-run mongodb server to connect on database
 4- run the web app with the command ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json for angular
 this command let app using proxy.config.json file to solve the cors origin problem.
 the web app will request the server and retrieve the tweets from the database which is saved after fetching data from twitter.
